If you want to see de-obfuscated stack traces, you'll need to use [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard) with Sentry. To do so, upload the ProGuard mapping files by either the recommended method of using our [Gradle integration](/platforms/android/gradle/) or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

Support for Guardsquare's ProGuard and [DexGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/dexguard) was added in version 3.0.0 of the [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/gradle/).

<Note>

The Android SDK ships with ProGuard rules automatically defined; no further configuration is needed.

## In-App Frames

For unobfuscated builds, the Android SDK will automatically set all frames coming from the App as `in-app` frames, based on `applicationId/packageName`. However, for obfuscated builds this is not possible on the client side. Therefore, you can define server-side rules for identifying the in-app frames, for example:

```discover {tabTitle:Enhancement Rules}
stack.module:com.mycompany.** +app
```

For more information see [StackTrace Rules](/product/data-mana/gement-settings/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#mark-in-app-frames/)
