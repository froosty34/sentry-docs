To show readable stack traces in your Sentry errors, once configured, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK will generate and upload source maps automatically.

To upload source maps, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK uses the [Sentry Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) under the hood. See the [Manual Configuration](../manual-setup/) page and the Sentry [Webpack Plugin documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#cli-configuration) for more details.
