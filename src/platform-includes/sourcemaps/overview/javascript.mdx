## Uploading Source Maps To Sentry

We compiled a list of guides on how to upload source maps to Sentry for the most popular JavaScript build tools:

- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/webpack/">Webpack</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/rollup/">Rollup</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/vite/">Vite</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/esbuild/">esbuild</PlatformLink>

- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/uglifyjs/">UglifyJS</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/systemjs/">SystemJS</PlatformLink>

### Other Tools

If you are not using one of these tools we assume you already know how to generate source maps for your toolchain and we recommend you upload them via Sentry CLI. <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/">learn more</PlatformLink>

<Note>Though we strongly recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, for browser applications it is also possible to host your source maps publicly. <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/hosting-publicly/">learn more</PlatformLink></Note>
